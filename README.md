Project Description: 

This goal of this project was to make the average person’s commute to work or school a little more interesting.  The way I thought I could do this is by having them play a simulated adventure game where the world is their map and they must enter dungeons and fight monsters that will be spawned around the real world. I was heavily inspired by the groundbreaking game Pokémon Go and thought it was a great starting point for a more role-playing based game. A very useful source that I found was a tutorial at https://www.raywenderlich.com/823-advanced-mapkit-tutorial-custom-tiles. I followed this tutorial and expanded on the provided code to bring my game idea to life.
